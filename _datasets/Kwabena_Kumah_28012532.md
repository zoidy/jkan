title: 'Global Snow and Ice Cover (1980–1987): An Extended GMASI Dataset'
organization: University of Arizona
notes: |
    This dataset provides globally continuous, daily snow and ice cover information at a high spatial resolution 
    (0.1° latitude/longitude grid) for the period from January 1, 1980, to June 30, 1987. It extends the Global 
    Automated Snow and Ice Mapping System (GMASI) dataset, which begins in July 1987. For access to GMASI snow 
    and ice cover data starting in 1987, users can visit: 
    https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/pub/smcd/emb/snow/gmasi_reprocessing/dailymaps/data/.

    The extended dataset was developed using advanced machine learning techniques, specifically a Random 
    Forest algorithm, applied to ERA5 reanalysis data. This dataset is designed to support diverse applications, 
    including climate studies, hydrological modeling, and long-term precipitation analyses.

    *For inquiries regarding the contents of this dataset, please contact the Corresponding Author listed in the 
    README.txt file. Administrative inquiries (e.g., removal requests, trouble downloading, etc.) can be directed
